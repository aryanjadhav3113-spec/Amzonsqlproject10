This SQL program creates a **retail_orders database** with an **orders table** that stores order details like ID, customer ID, date, and amount. It inserts sample records and uses **window functions** with **SUM() OVER()** to calculate each customer’s **cumulative** and **monthly cumulative** order totals by date.
